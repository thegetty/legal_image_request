							</br>
							<h6>Terms Governing Reproduction or Publication of Images
								from the J. Paul Getty Museum Collections or Grounds</h6>
							</br>
							<ul class="decimal">
								<li>Written permission must be obtained from the J. Paul
									Getty Museum, an operating program of the J. Paul Getty Trust
									("the Getty") to reproduce or publish images ("the Image(s)")
									from or of the Getty's collections or grounds. The Getty will
									not permit reproduction for advertising or promotional
									purposes.</li>

								<li>Objects appearing in the Images, even if such objects
									are owned by the Getty, may be protected by copyright,
									publication rights, or related interests that are not owned by
									the Getty. The Getty is not giving permission to exploit any
									third party rights. The Applicant will ascertain whether any
									such rights exist, pay any royalties or fees claimed by any
									third party and obtain all other permission required to carry
									out Applicant's activities without infringing the proprietary
									rights of, breaching a duty to, or breaching an agreement with,
									any third party.</li>

								<li>Unless otherwise indicated, permission is granted only
									for one usage in the Publication in one edition and in one
									language. Additional language editions, subsequent editions and
									other derivative works based on the Publication must be
									separately licensed.</li>

								<li>The permission and license granted herein is for
									reproduction and publication of the Image(s) in analog formats
									only. Applicant may only make digital copies as absolutely
									necessary in intermediate process steps to the creation of a
									book or periodical published exclusively in analog format. The
									Getty does not otherwise grant permission to reproduce or
									process any Image(s) in any digital format, and such permission
									must be separately obtained in writing.</li>

								<li>Duplicates may not be made of the Images supplied by
									the Getty without the Getty's prior written approval. Any
									duplicates are the property of the Getty and will be
									immediately provided to the Getty by Applicant.</li>

								<li>Each Image that is reproduced must be unaltered and
									must be included in its entirety, and nothing may be
									superimposed on the Image unless approved in writing by the
									Getty. The reproduction may not be cropped or otherwise trimmed
									to fit a format, bled off the page, guttered across facing
									pages, or printed on colored stock. Nor may any black and white
									Image be printed with colored ink. When a detail is used, the
									word "detail" must appear in the credit line.</li>

								<li>Except as described below, full identification of the
									Image(s), the credit line and any copyright notice that is
									provided to you with the Image(s) must appear on the same page
									as the Image(s), or on the opposite page, or the reverse in the
									Publication. If the Getty's Image(s) would be the only one(s)
									in the Publication giving the full information in one of the
									above-stated locations, then the Applicant may list only the
									artist's name, title of work, and date. However, the complete
									documentation must appear elsewhere within the Publication.</li>

								<li>The Getty reserves the right to limit the number of
									reproductions of Getty-owned property in any single publication
									if it appears that their number is disproportionate in relation
									to those from other sources.</li>

								<li>No license or permission granted pursuant to this
									Application may be assigned by Applicant. This Application and
									any attached and cross-referenced pages sets forth the entire
									agreement of the Getty and Applicant regarding the Image(s)
									identified in this Application, and supercedes all prior
									promises, representations, or statements of any kind, whether
									written or oral. This Application may only be modified in
									writing signed by an authorized representative of the Getty and
									expressly stating its intention to modify this Application.
									This Application will be governed by the law of the State of
									California without regard to its conflicts of laws principles.
									All litigation arising under or relating to this Application
									will be filed and prosecuted in any court of competent subject
									matter jurisdiction in the City of Los Angeles, California.
									Applicant consents to the personal jurisdiction of such courts
									for such purpose.</li>

								<li>The reproduction permission granted hereby is limited
									to a non-exclusive reproduction license solely on the terms set
									forth herein. The Getty retains all copyright ownership and all
									rights to exploit its copyrights where applicable. All rights
									not expressly granted herein are reserved to the Getty. If
									reproduction is to be made from materials depicting the Getty's
									property, but not supplied by the Getty, the Getty reserves the
									right to approve these materials.</li>

								<li>Applicant will obtain the Getty's prior written
									approval of final presentation of the Image(s) prior to general
									distribution or publication of the Publication if required by
									the Getty. Such approval will not be unreasonably withheld, and
									will be based upon the presentation of the image as regards
									color, cropping, identification, credit, placement with other
									images, etc.</li>

								<li>Applicant will defend, indemnify, and hold the Getty
									harmless from all claims, causes and allegations (whether
									threatened or pending), costs, fees and expenses (including
									reasonable attorneys' fees), awards, judgments, damages, losses
									and liabilities arising from or relating to any breach of this
									Application by Applicant or the officers, directors,
									shareholders, employees, agents, representatives, contractors
									and subcontractors of Applicant, including, without limitation,
									any claim, cause, or allegation asserted by a third party
									against the Getty based entirely or in part on Applicant's
									exploitation of the Image(s) licensed hereunder.</li>

								<li>Applicant will send one (1) gratis copy of the
									publication to the Assistant Registrar for Rights and
									Reproductions, the J. Paul Getty Museum.</li>

								<li>Unless otherwise indicated, permission is granted only
									for one Production in one language. Additional language
									versions, works including subtitles, and other derivative works
									based on the Production must be separately licensed.</li>

								<li>The permission and license granted herein is for the
									Production only. Applicant may only make analog or digital
									copies as absolutely necessary in intermediate process steps to
									the creation of a video, film, CD-ROM, DVD, electronic

									permission to reproduce or process any Image(s) in any digital
									format, and such permission must be separately obtained in
									writing.</li>

								<li>Duplicates may not be made of the Images supplied by
									the Getty without the Getty's prior written approval. Any
									duplicates are the property of the Getty and will be
									immediately provided to the Getty by Applicant. Applicant will
									employ technology that will prevent copying of the Image(s)
									from the digital Production and will prosecute infringement.</li>

								<li>Each Image that appears in the Production must be
									unaltered and must be included in its entirety, and nothing may
									be superimposed on the Image unless approved in writing by the
									Getty. The Image may not be reproduced in a single color. The
									size of an Image provided for Web and other electronic uses may
									not be reduced by more than 60%. If a reduction of 60% or more
									is required, another smaller image must be requested. These
									Images may not be enlarged. When a detail is used, the word
									"detail" must appear in the credit line.</li>

								<li>Except as described below, full identification of the
									Image(s), the credit line and any copyright notice that is
									provided to you with the Image(s) must appear adjacent to the
									Image(s). If the Getty's Image(s) would be the only one(s) in
									the Production giving the full information in this location,
									then the information must be included in the credits.</li>

								<li>The Getty reserves the right to limit the number of
